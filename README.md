# Pontoon
A CLI game made with PHP. I wanted to see if I could build a game with OOP.

Ensure you have PHP installed on your machine. You can type ```php -v``` into your terminal to check. If not, then go ahead and download PHP onto your machine.

## How to start
- Git clone this project onto your local machine
- Navigate to where you have dowloaded this project via the terminal
- Run ```./index.php``` to start playing the game!

## How to play
There are instructions within the CLI program that will teach you how to play. Essentially, you want to draw cards until your hand adds up to the value of 21.
Be careful though, if you draw too many cards you'll go bust! If your hand value is less than 21, then you still lose. Try to see if you can get your hand value to total 21!
All face cards are equivalent to 10. An ace is equivalent to 1.
